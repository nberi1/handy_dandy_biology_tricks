How to run checkInserts.py to check if your oligo of interest is in the sequenced fragment

0. You need python3
	if you don't have it I can help you install it

1. Download and unzip your sequencing results

2. Copy the files in the checkInserts folder into the folder containing the sequencing results
	checkInserts.py
	guide_oligos.csv
	directions.txt (optional)

3. Fill in the columns of guide_oligos.csv with your sequences
	you can put in as many sequences as you would like
	Save and close the file

4a. To get results for all files in the folder
	Run the following line of code:

for FILE in *.seq; do \ python3 checkInserts.py $FILE >> results.txt \ done

OR 

4b. To get results for just ONE file at a time
	Replace (FILENAME) with the sequencing file you want to check
	Run the following line of code:

python3 checkInserts.py (FILENAME).seq >> results.txt

5. results.txt now contains a list of matched sequences

Notes: - As of now the program only checks sequences in column 2
	column 3 is a placeholder for checking revcoms
